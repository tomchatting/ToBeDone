## 1. About
This is a really really really **really** simple app that uses a tutorial I found somewhere just to break me into Android development. Basically I want a Todo app for my phone and here it is.
To make stuff look pretty I break a few things, they're covered in the next section. If it doesn't work on your phone, *fix it yourself* (or offer me cake).

## 2. Issues
* On versions of Android less than 3.0 this app WILL look like shit. The HoloLightDarkActionBarTheme is Android 3.0 and above AFAIK, basically this app looks like Ice Creamy Sexy Goodness on 4.0.3, running it in a 2.3.3 emulator I can tell you it looks the complete opposite on versions not Ice Creamy.
* On versions of Android less than 3.0 you need to use the MENU button to be able to do anything (add a task, confirm a task)
* You can create blank tasks
* Pressing back instead of confirm saves a task
* The icon is off by a pixel. A PIXEL.
